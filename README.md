Two command line tools:

scanner.py scans specified IP address range and gives output of live host IP addresses. After launching a program from the command line, user needs to input manually network address, starting host address and last host address.

port.py scans specified port for IP address and gives information whether the port is open or not. After launching a program, user should manually input desired IP address and port number.

For using these command line tools you need to have installed python 2.7 on the machine.
